User stories:
I can save stocks by stock ticker and amount of shares.
I can see a list of my stocks
I can mark stocks I own and stocks I'm interested in
Stretch goals:
I can see real time prices on my stocks
I can see the total value of my stocks

Building out Stocki was easier and harder than I expected. The front end went more
smoothly as my experience with JS has gone up quite a bit and I had a lot of
lessons learned from the tic tac toe app to draw on. The API was initially simple
as well, but when it came to integrating the 3rd party API things got more
complicated. I had to do a lot of research into things I had never done before,
particularly into requests from one API to another. Getting that up and running
took significantly more time than I was expecting, so unfortunately prettying
up the app got moved into the next version.

Next steps to tackle:
CSS and bootstrap it to make it look good
Add function to to calculate value of user shares
Add ability to mark stocks as owned vs tracked

Cheers,
Gordon
